# react-navigation-custom-drawer-example
This is just a really simple demo showing how to do a really cool drawer using react-navigation.

This is still a WIP, it works but the code may contains some magic number and non optimized stuff.

 - App.js contain the initialisation of the react-navigation drawer.
